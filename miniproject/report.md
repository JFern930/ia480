## Data source
Dataset used for this project was the World Happiness Report.
The World Happiness Report dataset was pulled from Kaggle and is also on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JFern930/ia480/blob/main/miniproject/world_happiness_report.csv)

## Research Question
I tried to predict the Happiness Score of countries based on GDP per capita, political stability, mental health, and other factors.

## Target Variable 
Happiness Score, with Key Predictor Variables being GDP per capita and country.

## Data Cleaning Process
I removed any features that have missing values.

## Training Process
The Happiness_Score variable was selected to be used for modeling.

## Model Performance
The R-Square, RMSE, and MSE scores were remarkably low, indicating the difficulty of the model's evaluation of Happiness. This indicated measuring and predicting Happiness is very difficult, and a more tangible variable should be selected for obersvation in the future.
